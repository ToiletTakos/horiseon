First step was reviewing the HTML to make sure everything was funtional.

Changed title from website to Horiseon
Went through and added comments
Changed header div to header and fixed CSS by removing the . from the header selector.
Changed the header h1 to be clickable.

Second step was to review the CSS to make sure again that everything was funtional

Added comments to CSS
Noticed many duplicated CSS code elements. Made a note of each duplication with comments.
Went through and re-classed the HTML classes to fit one class and then moved over to the CSS and changed the class to the new class and consolidated code.

Created: Primary-boarder, section-title, .benefit-img consolidation
