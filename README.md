Review the HTML to make sure everything was funtional.

Changed title from website to Horiseon.
Went through and added comments
Changed header div to header and fixed CSS by removing the . from the header selector.
Changed the header h1 to be clickable.
Made sure each Navigation item was correctly liked to their named section by checking id's in content section to match.
Checked to see if all images had their alt for accessability.

Review the CSS to make sure again that everything was funtional

Added comments to CSS
Noticed many duplicated CSS code elements. Made a note of each duplication with comments.
Went through and re-classed the HTML classes to fit one class and then moved over to the CSS and changed the class to the new class and consolidated code.
Re-organized some code so that each area was grouped together rather then spread out throughout the CSS document.

Consolidated: .benefits div, .benefits h3 .benefit img, .content div, .content img, .content h2.
